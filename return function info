return means, "output this value from this function".

The return statement causes your function to exit and hand back a value to its caller. The point of functions in general is to take in inputs and return something. The return statement is used when a function is ready to return a value to its caller.

Basically return not about just returning it gives output in object form so that we can save that return value from function to any variable

a return statement causes execution to leave the current subroutine and resume at the point in the code immediately after where the subroutine was called, known as its return address


recursion

calculating a number by the repeated application of an algorithm.

process of returning or running back.

Recursion is a process in which a function calls itself as a subroutine. This allows the function to be repeated several times, since it calls itself during its execution.


	def calculateTaxAmount(self, taxes, qty, price_unit):
		amount_tax = 0
		child_tax = 0
		for tax in taxes:
			if tax.enable_child_tax:
				if tax.children_tax_ids:
					child_tax = 0
					for childtax in tax.children_tax_ids:
						child_amount_tax = qty * price_unit * (childtax.amount/100) * (tax.amount/100)
		
						child_tax = child_tax + child_amount_tax 
					parent_tax = qty * price_unit * (tax.amount /100)
					amount_tax+ = child_tax + parent_tax
			else:
				amount_tax += qty * price_unit * (tax.amount /100)
		
		return amount_tax
